I did not collaborate with anyone for this assignment. This was an absolute individual effort on my part.

Sequence of tasks:
1. Enter the number of test blocks less than 27 on the welcome screen. Else leave it blank and click on start.
2. Start clicking on the green target on each screen. The user will see his/her progress at the bottom of the screen throughout the experiment.
3. The user will get to use both pointer and bubble cursor.
4. Once the experiment is complete, fill out the survey in the end in the form of a Google form.
